# Coding-PvP-E2s

Basicly a complete set of together working e2s made for adding more features to pvp

Dodge E2 - Adds a dodge feature, works using directional key (wasd, space, control) and combined with mouse5 or any other key you want to replace it with, this will allow one to do a fast dodge.
One has a limited amount of dodges, altho they do refill over time, you can customized how many dodges you get or make the amount infinite, note that the more dodges you have and the stronger the force is,
the longer it takes to get them back.

Slide E2 - Adds a basic slide feature, run and crouch when you want to slide

Combat Stims E2 - Adds some fancy stims that can give you health and armor, both amounts are customizable, altho you can't separate them without creating another e2, same as with the dodge,
the more health or armor it gives the longer getting the stims back takes same for the max amount of stims you can have if increased
when you click H it will use a stim btw.

Ehanced Combat Hud E2 - This nice thing adds a simple hud with custom crosshair (crosshair 0 to disable default crosshair), not only that it shows info of the latest enemy you have gotten to your sights such as
name, health, armor and weapon. this information will stay until you find a new target to look at. Crosshair changes color depending if target has godmode on, Red means no god, Green means god is on, White is the default color
right bottom shows the gun you are using. if you press G you can cycle through 2 visions, night vision which also highlights blood, and thermal/flir (flir_enable 1/0)

noteably, requires wire_expression2_concmd 1
you can wire the last 3 e2s into a same EGP Hud

for the combat hud i am working on a killstreak feature, it also counts kills all together
